# Gammapy Coding Sprint, October 2018, Madrid

* Start: Monday, October 1, 2018 at 2 pm
* End: Friday, October 5, 2018 at noon
* Location: UCM Madrid, Spain. Faculty of physics, third floor room 218B.
* Contacts: [Jose Luis Contreras](mailto:jlcontreras@fis.ucm.es),

This meeting is a "coding sprint" for people that want to work on Gammapy
(http://gammapy.org/). You're very welcome if you're new to coding or haven't
contributed to Gammapy yet. But note that this is not a workshop how to use
Gammapy. We will also not do any tutorials how to hack on Gammapy, i.e. teach
git, Github, Python, pytest and Sphinx. Instead we will pair experienced and new
people and learn hands-on. If you want to prepare a bit, have a look at
[gammapy-dev-tutorial](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-dev-tutorial) and
learn a bit on your own before the coding sprint. Join the Gammapy Slack and
feel free to ask anything there.

## Travel and hotel

You can find our location and directions of hotels at the High Energy Physics group page
(https://www.gae.ucm.es), right hand side, under the **Useful information** section.
The university can be reached from the city or the airport by metro, station *Ciudad Universitaria*
(line 6, grey), from there it is just a ten minutes walk to the faculty. 

## Agenda

Monday afternoon is for presentations and discussions.

The rest of the week is for work in small groups, mostly pair coding.
